  # You can write dconf or gsettings.
  # - Note that GnuCash populates gsettings defaults but not dconf.
  # - If you write to either place, it'll be reflected in the other
  #   place, but dconf only lists key you've changed. So gsettings
  #   shows you all possible settings, and dconf only shows what
  #   you've changed.

    #   if the client still has a week to pay, what's the purpose of the
    #   alert? So I can prod the client to pay? But why would I want to do
    #   that, if they still have another week to pay? / In my case, all my
    #   clients pay like clockwork, about 1 week before the technical due
    #   date. So the GnuCash alert -- to me -- only serves to remind me to
    #   update my books (import recent bank transactions into GnuCash, and
    #   assign payments to invoices).
