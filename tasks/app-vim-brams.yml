# [lb]: I originally built Vim from source starting 2017-02-27 to support
# Command-T (activiated bu <Ctrl-D>), which requires Vim be built with
# Ruby, and that the version of Ruby match that of the OS. Or so I'm led
# to believe.
# - 2020-03-06: Now's it nice just to have latest Vim, and to use custom icons!

# 2017-11-03: If commant-t does not work, Ctrl-D shows error, e.g.,:
#
#   Vim Ruby version: 2.3.1-p112
#   Expected version: 2.3.3-p222
#
# Make sure you build command-t with the system Ruby:
#
#   cd ~/.vim/pack/wincent/start/command-t/ruby/command-t/ext/command-t
#   chruby system
#   ruby extconf.rb
#   make

# 2017-11-03: I am not sure these environs do anything,
#   since the build just uses the system ruby...
#export RUBY_VER=23
#export RUBY_VER_LONG=2.3.3

# See `./configure --help`
# - Add ruby for commandt
# - Add python3 for ternjs
# - Add python2 for vim-instanbul
# 2 ways to install dependencies:
# - Blindly, via
#     sudo apt-get build-dep vim
# - Or with familiar knowledge of required pacakges, e.g.,
#     sudo apt install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
# - See zoidy_mintyfresh for package installation
#   (so you don't have to run this task with -K/credentials):

# Verify that the correct Ruby was enabled by comparing:

# MAYBE/2018-12-26: Add verification step to this task. [Meh.]
