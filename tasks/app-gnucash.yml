    # ----
    # 2020-11-15: (lb): I assembled this list from the GnuCash Wiki.
    #   https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Installing_Dependencies
    # See also in source:
    #   README.dependencies
    # - Note that neither Wiki nor source document are necessarily up to date.
    #   - E.g., I was able to build with versions indicated in the Wiki,
    #     but then at runtime I found issues, such as:
    #     - "boost > 1.50.0", but GnuCash complains unless 1.67 or better.
    #     - "guile >= 2.0.0", but `gnucash-cli --report ...` prints ERRORs
    #       when built and used with guile 2.0.
    # - I've also included additional libraries that I found (through make
    #   trial-and-error) that I needed to build v3.10 (and that I didn't
    #   bother to determine if I still need to build v4.2; it's easier
    #   just to keep them).
    #
    # *** libtool
    - libtool
    - libltdl-dev
    # *** icu
    - icu-devtools

    # *** "boost > 1.50.0 - requires locale and regex built with ICU support"
    # - See the `lib-libboost` task.
    # - Or, if the host's distro includes > 1.67, try:
    #   - libboost-all-dev
    # *** "guile >= 2.0.0"
    # - I found that I need guile-2.2.
    #   (I also tried (and failed) to use guile 3.0 (installed from source)
    #   but that's a longer tale, and if guile 2.2 works, I'm happy.)
    - guile-2.2
    - guile-2.2-dev
    # *** "swig > 2.0.10 - swig3.0 on some systems"
    # (lb): Yup, there's no swig2.0 on Mint 19.3. It's `swig` or `swig3.0`.

    # v4.2 Optional: OFX File importing
    # ---------------------------------
    # "This will automatically install the corresponding libofx<n> package as well."
    - libofx-dev

    # v4.2 Optional: AqBanking (Online Banking)
    # -----------------------------------------
    # *aqbanking*: "# > v4.0.0"

    # *gwenhywfar*
    - gwenhywfar-tools
    - libgwenhywfar60
    - libgwenhywfar60-dev
    # 2020-11-15: I found (make trial-and-error discovered) that I needed
    # this library to build v3.10. Not sure about v4.2. (But for v3.10, I
    # had not installed gwenhywfar-tools or libgwenhywfar60-dev.)
    - libgwenhywfar-core-dev
    # libgwengui*: "included in tarball prior to v3.905/V4 beta"
    # 2020-11-15: Linux Mint 19.3 (Ubuntu 18.04) has *-0 variant of this lib:
    #  - libgwengui-gtk3
    - libgwengui-gtk3-0
    - libgwengui-gtk3-dev

    # v4.2 Optional: Python Support (Python Bindings)
    # -----------------------------------------------
    # NOTE: Not including. But if you do:
    #   "use the appropriate cmake option switch during the build"
    #  - python3-pytest

    # v4.2 Distribution-Specific *Focal Fossa 20.04 LTS* Issue
    # --------------------------------------------------------
    # If you were to run `apt-get build-dep gnucash`, per
    #   https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Building_On_Linux
    # then you need to manually install this library as well:
    #  - libboost-program-options1.71-dev
    # (lb): Except I don't (yet) have a 20.04 host, and (probably more
    # importantly) I'm not calling build-dep (instead see list of deps
    # above), oh and also see `lib-libboost` which installs this lib to:
    #   ~/.local/include/boost_1_74_0/libs/program_options/

    # v4.2 Unknown: Libraries I needed to build v3.10
    # -----------------------------------------------
    # 2020-11-15: In addition to some of the libraries above, I found
    # (aka discovered through make after make after make trial-and-error)
    # that I needed these libraries to build v3.10. Not sure about v4.2.
    # But can't hurt to keep; while discarding might break the build (any
    # I wouldn't find out until I ran this task on a new host, which could
    # be a while).
